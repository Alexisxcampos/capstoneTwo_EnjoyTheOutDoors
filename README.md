<h2 align="center">Welcome!</h2>

 This capstone project features JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS, with it's main focus being JavaScript.
 <br>
 Given a 6,000 line long array with all the national parks in the United States and their information listed, I was able to successfully create two quick and straight forward ways for users to navigate through the array. Users are able to find the park of their dreams through two categories: location (state/territory) or park type. 
 <br>
 Additionally, I have given users the opportunity to easily search through an array listing all mountains in the United States by their location (state/terriorty) using a similar method.  
  In this code, you can witness flawless execution of event handling, function declaration, array operations, string inerpolation and HTML Manipulation.
 See below for snippets of my webpage.

 <b>Comments:</b> JavaScript is a new beast for me to conquer. The majority of my alloted time for this project went towards building and troubleshooting functions

 <b>Comments:</b> Looks pretty, right? Thanks. Behind the scenes, two event listener were made for each radio button. Upon click, there is a different function set to run for each radio button. These functions append the appropriate dropdown options to match the selected category.
